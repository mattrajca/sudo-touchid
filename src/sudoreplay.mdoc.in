.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sudoreplay
plays back or lists the output logs created by
.Nm sudo .
When replaying,
.Nm sudoreplay
can play the session back in real-time, or the playback speed may be
adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command line options.
.Pp
The
.Em ID
should be a six character sequence of digits and
upper case letters, e.g.\&
.Li 0100A5 .
When a command is run via
.Nm sudo
with
.Em log_output
enabled in the
.Em sudoers
file, a
.Li TSID=ID
string is logged via syslog or to the
.Nm sudo
log file.
The
.Em ID
may also be determined using
.Nm sudoreplay Ns 's
list mode.
.Pp
In list mode,
.Nm sudoreplay
can be used to find the ID of a session based on a number of criteria
such as the user, tty or command run.
.Pp
In replay mode, if the standard output has not been redirected,
.Nm sudoreplay
will act on the following keys:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It So Li \  Sc Pq space
Pause output; press any key to resume.
.It Ql <
Reduce the playback speed by one half.
.It Ql >
Double the playback speed.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Fl d Ar directory
Use
.Ar directory
to for the session logs instead of the default,
.Pa @iolog_dir@ .
.It Fl f Ar filter
By default,
.Nm sudoreplay
will play back the command's standard output, standard error and tty output.
The
.Fl f
option can be used to select which of these to output.
The
.Ar filter
argument is a comma-separated list, consisting of one or more of following:
.Em stdout ,
.Em stderr ,
and
.Em ttyout .
.It Fl h
The
.Fl h Pq Em help
option causes
.Nm sudoreplay
to print a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl l Op Ar search expression
Enable
.Dq list mode .
In this mode,
.Nm sudoreplay
will list available sessions in a format similar to the
.Nm sudo
log file format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).
If a
.Ar search expression
is specified, it will be used to restrict the IDs that are displayed.
An expression is composed of the following predicates:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It command Ar pattern
Evaluates to true if the command run matches
.Ar pattern .
On systems with POSIX regular expression support, the pattern may
be an extended regular expression.
On systems without POSIX regular expression support, a simple substring
match is performed instead.
.It cwd Ar directory
Evaluates to true if the command was run with the specified current
working directory.
.It fromdate Ar date
Evaluates to true if the command was run on or after
.Ar date .
See
.Sx Date and time format
for a description of supported date and time formats.
.It group Ar runas_group
Evaluates to true if the command was run with the specified
.Ar runas_group .
Note that unless a
.Ar runas_group
was explicitly specified when
.Nm sudo
was run this field will be empty in the log.
.It runas Ar runas_user
Evaluates to true if the command was run as the specified
.Ar runas_user .
Note that
.Nm sudo
runs commands as user
.Em root
by default.
.It todate Ar date
Evaluates to true if the command was run on or prior to
.Ar date .
See
.Sx Date and time format
for a description of supported date and time formats.
.It tty Ar tty name
Evaluates to true if the command was run on the specified terminal device.
The
.Ar tty name
should be specified without the
.Pa /dev/
prefix, e.g.\&
.Pa tty01
instead of
.Pa /dev/tty01 .
.It user Ar user name
Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run by
.Ar user name .
.El
.Pp
Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string (currently
all predicates may be shortened to a single character).
.Pp
Predicates may be combined using
.Em and ,
.Em or
and
.Em \&!
operators as well as
.Ql \&(
and
.Ql \&)
grouping (note that parentheses must generally be escaped from the shell).
The
.Em and
operator is optional, adjacent predicates have an implied
.Em and
unless separated by an
.Em or .
.It Fl m Ar max_wait
Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key presses or output data.
By default,
.Nm sudoreplay
will accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or program output.
However, this can be tedious when the session includes long pauses.
When the
.Fl m
option is specified,
.Nm sudoreplay
will limit these pauses to at most
.Em max_wait
seconds.
The value may be specified as a floating point number, e.g.\&
.Em 2.5 .
.It Fl s Ar speed_factor
This option causes
.Nm sudoreplay
to adjust the number of seconds it will wait between key presses or
program output.
This can be used to slow down or speed up the display.
For example, a
.Ar speed_factor
of
.Em 2
would make the output twice as fast whereas a
.Ar speed_factor
of
.Em .5
would make the output twice as slow.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V Pq Em version
option causes
.Nm sudoreplay
to print its version number
and exit.
.El
.Ss Date and time format
The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats include:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.
.It HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and day names
may be abbreviated.
Note that month and day of the week names must be specified in English.
.It CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
ISO time format
.It DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
The month name may be abbreviated.
.El
.Pp
Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are optional.
If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if no time is
specified, the first second of the specified date is used.
The less significant parts of both time and date may also be omitted,
in which case zero is assumed.
.Pp
The following are all valid time and date specifications:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It now
The current time and date.
.It tomorrow
Exactly one day from now.
.It yesterday
24 hours ago.
.It 2 hours ago

.It this week

.It a fortnight ago
